## An Introduction to Cost of Living and College Education in the US

#### Cost of Living and Education can vary greatly depending on which state/region you live in the US. However, having a general overview of how the cost of some household 
#### necessities have changed over time and how much you can expect to pay for College can give one a better understanding of what kinds of numbers they will be dealing with.

### Region
##### For this dashboard I have decided to focus on the US as a region - even though my immediate audience of college students at Westmont is generally from the Western United States,
##### I have decided to go with the broader region because it fits the idea of a general overview, plus it makes it more relaible for future audiences that might come from other States (or even internationally for people that are considering lviing in the US and have no idea of the costs associated with it)>

## Data 
##### First, I have selected the Median Income for a household data set to represent the Median Income over the years - It was a well organized data set and gives the audience a good anchor throughout the app. 
##### To represent the cost of different household necessities over time, I have selected the four different data sets from the Federal Bank of St.Louis that each represent individually how the consumer price index
##### of housing, fuel and necessitites, cars/vehicles (used) and food (prepared at home) have changed over time. I have selected the last two in order to represent "normal" families that are trying to save money by eating at home and driving used vehicles.
##### I chose the Consumer price index because I thought it was a different angle, plus in the data base these were the data sets that represented household necessities as a whole rather than just single items like beef or rent.
