"1For public institutions, “in-district” refers to the charges paid by a student who lives in the locality surrounding the institution, such as a county. In-district and in-state charges did not differ for 82.8 percent of public institutions included in this table in 2021–22 and for 82.9 percent of public institutions included in this table in 2023–24.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2On-campus average cost is based on those institutions that offer on-campus housing and/or meal service. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3Off-campus average cost is based on those institutions that do not require full-time, first-time students to live on campus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4""Other expenses” refers to the amount of money (estimated by financial aid office) needed by a student to cover expenses such as laundry, transportation, and entertainment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: Title IV institutions are those with a written agreement with the U.S. Department of Education that allows the institution to participate in any of the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs. United States includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, and the U.S. Air Force Academy are not Title IV eligible but are included in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) universe because they are federally funded and open to the public; they are not included in this table. The U.S. Merchant Marine Academy is Title IV eligible and is included in this table. Amounts are institutional averages as reported by the institution, not average amounts paid by students (i.e., charges are not weighted by enrollment). Percentage change was computed using unrounded average costs. The time points displayed in this table were chosen to demonstrate the range of data available from IPEDS for trend analysis, not to emphasize any particular period of change. Out-of-state average tuition and required fees were used for private institutions that reported varying tuitions by residency. Institutions with academic calendars that differ by program or allow continuous enrollment are not included in this table. All amounts from 2021–22 were converted to 2023 dollars using the average Consumer Price Index values for the 12-month periods ending in December 2021 and December 2023. Data from both time points in this table are from the same source. Definitions for terms used in this table may be found in the IPEDS online glossary located at https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/glossary. The glossary is primarily focused on terms used in the current IPEDS collection and may not reflect the definitions in effect when the data in this table were collected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
